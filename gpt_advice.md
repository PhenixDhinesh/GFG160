This is a **really common** and important stage you're in — you're thoughtful, solving problems with intention, and not brute-forcing. That’s a **great sign**. The next step is **speeding up reflection and simplifying your thinking patterns**. Here's how to make that transition:

---

### 🧭 1. **Understand Problem Types, Not Just Problems**

Start seeing problems as **patterns**. Most coding problems fall into categories:

* **Sliding window / two pointers**
* **Prefix sums / running values**
* **Greedy**
* **Dynamic programming**
* **Binary search on answer**
* **Monotonic stack/queue**
* **Graph traversal (BFS/DFS)**
* **Backtracking / recursion**

📌 **Action:** Build a mental checklist. When you read a problem, ask:

> “Is this like a greedy problem?”
> “Is this about subarrays or running values?”
> “Do I need optimal at every step or global?”

This helps you **skip brainstorming** and go straight into **mapping it to known techniques**.

---

### 🧠 2. **Ask Simpler Questions Early**

Speed doesn’t come from jumping into code faster — it comes from **simpler mental models**.

Instead of:

> “How do I build a solution that tracks all sell-buy events correctly?”

Ask:

> “What’s the *core invariant* I need to track per iteration?”

This often reduces the mental load, and unlocks cleaner approaches like the GFG one.

### ⏳ 3. **Time Your Thinking Stages**

Use this rough timer system:

| Stage                                   | Target Time |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Understand input/output & constraints   | 2–4 min     |
| Identify pattern (e.g., greedy? DP?)    | 5 min max   |
| Decide direction (brute, then optimize) | 10–15 min   |
| Implementation                          | 10–20 min   |

📌 If you’re stuck in **thinking longer than 15 min**, step back and rephrase the problem in your own words **without looking at constraints**. This often resets the brain.

---

### 🧰 4. **Practice Micro-Patterns Daily**

Instead of solving big problems only, train with:

* **"What’s the best approach?"** for a given problem — no code.
* **Pattern-matching drills** — just label problem types.
* **Refactor drills** — take your own solution and reduce it.

> 🧠 Think of it like gym workouts: don’t lift heavy every day; train form and speed too.

---

### 🧪 5. **Debug Your Thinking After Solving**

After each problem, ask:

* “What mental model did I start with?”
* “Was there a simpler way to see this?”
* “Did I overcomplicate the state I was tracking?”
* “Could I have solved this with just one variable?”

Write **one-liner takeaways** per problem.

> For your example:
> *“I focused on buy/sell events. I could have just tracked the lowest price and max profit at each step.”*

---

### 🚀 Bonus Habits:

* **Re-solve problems the next day** → reinforce pattern.
* **Explain your approach out loud** → helps spot over-complication.
* **Use constraints** — they’re clues, not decorations.

### 🎯 TL;DR – Summary of Mindset Shifts:

| Old Thinking                         | Better Thinking                              |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Track every detail                   | Track only what’s *needed to compute output* |
| Solve from scratch each time         | Map to known techniques (greedy, DP, etc.)   |
| Worry about correctness first        | Aim for simple, correct-enough core idea     |
| Think bottom-up (brute then improve) | Think top-down (final result first)          |

Keep going — your instincts are strong, and you're **1 mindset shift away** from faster, clearer problem solving. Let me know if you want a daily routine or pattern sheet to guide this.
